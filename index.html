They offer a simple, cost-effective solution by directly connecting the motor to the power supply. Dol starters are majorly used in applications that require high initial currents and voltage levels such as driving a maize milling machine and in most pump systems.</p> <h2>Components</h2> <ul> <li><b>Contactor:</b> The magnetic contactors act as electromagnetically operated switches. It uses electromagnetic energy to close switches, which consist of a coil placed on the iron core.</li> <li><b>Overload Relay:</b> Overload relay prevents motor damage. It monitors the current in the motor and breaks the circuit when a fault is detected.</li> <li><b>Start Button:</b> It helps to supply power to the motor to start the motor.</li> <li><b>Stop Button:</b> It helps to cut down the electrical supply to the motor.</li> <li><b>Auxiliary Contacts:</b> Auxiliary contacts are electromechanical devices used in switching equipment such as contactors, circuit breakers, switches, and relays. These secondary switching devices are physically connected to the main switching equipment and work at the same time.</li> </ul> <h2>Wiring Diagram</h2><p>Below is a wirng diagram of a DOL Motor starter</p> <img src="pn19.png" alt="DOL Starter Wiring Diagram"><p>At Stanley Kr, we specialize in providing comprehensive services for your industrial needs, including design, quotation, and installation services.
